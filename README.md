# SFML_Piano

Simple piano written in C++ using SFML language.
This is the first version, with only 8 musical notes from C4 to C5.
Notes are played from numbers 1 to 8.
1 -> C4; 8->C5.

The purpose for this project is to initiate my learning of C++ and SFML, any tips on the code would be extremelly appreciated.
Further version should have better code strategies as well as more features.

Some of the files are relative to CodeBlocks, the .CBP file is the CodeBlocks' project file.
